id: adm-pract-load
description: >-
    These sections describe a method of load balancing logs between multiple
    syslog-ng Open Source Edition (syslog-ng OSE) destinations. The first
    subsection describes the round robin load balancing method based on the
    R_MSEC macro of syslog-ng OSE, while the second subsection describes a
    configuration generator that you can use as an alternative to using the
    example configuration described in the first subsection.

syslog-ng OSE, see [[Macros of syslog-ng OSE]].
