title: Downloading sample pattern databases
id: adm-parser-db-download
description: >-
    To simplify the building of pattern databases, One Identity has released
    (and will continue to release) sample databases. You can download sample
    pattern databases from the [One Identity GitHub
    page](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng-patterndb/) (older samples
    are temporarily available
    [here](https://my.balabit.com/downloads/patterndb-snapshot/)).

Note that these pattern databases are only samples and experimental
databases. They are not officially supported, and may or may not work in
your environment.

The syslog-ng pattern databases are available under the Creative Commons

pattern database written by community contributors or the One Identity

open a GitHub issue, or send them to the [syslog-ng mailing
