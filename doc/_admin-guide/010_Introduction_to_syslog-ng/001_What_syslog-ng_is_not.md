The syslog-ng application is not log analysis software. It can filter
log messages and select only the ones matching certain criteria. It can
even convert the messages and restructure them to a predefined format,
or parse the messages and segment them into different fields. But
syslog-ng cannot interpret and analyze the meaning behind the messages,
or recognize patterns in the occurrence of different messages.
