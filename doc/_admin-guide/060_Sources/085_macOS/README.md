    In syslog-ng OSE 4.6 and later versions, it is possible to collect logs on macOS with the native OSLog framework using the `darwin-oslog()` and `darwin-oslog-stream()` source drivers.
---

* `darwin-oslog()`: This source builds on the native OSLog framework, instead of the earlier file-source based solution.
* `darwin-oslog-stream()`: This sourve provides a live log stream feed.
