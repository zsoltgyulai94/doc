    If you need help, want to open a support ticket, or report a bug, we
    recommend using the **syslog-ng-debun** tool to collect information
    about your environment and syslog-ng OSE version. For details, see the
    *syslog-ng-debun manual page*. For support contacts, see
    [[Technical support resources]].
