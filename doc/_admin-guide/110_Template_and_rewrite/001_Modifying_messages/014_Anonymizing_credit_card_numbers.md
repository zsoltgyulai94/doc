title: Anonymizing credit card numbers
id: adm-temp-anon-credit
description: >-
    Log messages of banking and e-commerce applications might include credit
    card numbers (Primary Account Number or PAN). According to privacy best
    practices and the requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data
    Security Standards (PCI-DSS), PAN must be rendered unreadable. The
    syslog-ng OSE application uses a regular expression to detect credit
    card numbers, and provides two ways to accomplish this: you can either
    mask the credit card numbers, or replace them with a hash. To mask the
    credit card numbers, use the credit-card-mask() or the
    credit-card-hash() rewrite rules in a log path.

**Declaration**

```config
@include "scl/rewrite/cc-mask.conf"

rewrite {
    credit-card-mask(value("<message-field-to-process>"));
};
```

By default, these rewrite rules process the MESSAGE part of the log
message.

## credit-card-hash()

|  Synopsis:   |credit-card-hash(value(\"\<message-field-to-process\>\"))|

*Description:* Process the specified message field (by default,
\${MESSAGE}), and replace any credit card numbers (Primary Account
Number or PAN) with a 16-character-long hash. This hash is generated by
calculating the SHA-1 hash of the credit card number, selecting the
first 64 bits of this hash, and representing this 64 bits in 16
characters.

## credit-card-mask()

|  Synopsis:   |credit-card-mask(value(\"\<message-field-to-process\>\"))|

*Description:* Process the specified message field (by default,
\${MESSAGE}), and replace the 7-12th character of any credit card
numbers (Primary Account Number or PAN) with asterisks (**\***). For
example, syslog-ng OSE replaces the number 5542043004559005 with
554204\*\*\*\*\*\*9005.
