description: >-
    The following sections describe the structure of log messages.
---

Currently there are two standard syslog message formats:

- The old standard described in RFC 3164 (also called the BSD-syslog
    or the legacy-syslog protocol): see
    [[BSD-syslog or legacy-syslog messages]].

- The new standard described in RFC 5424 (also called the IETF-syslog
    protocol): see [[IETF-syslog messages]].

- The Enterprise-wide message model or EWMM allows you to deliver
    structured messages between syslog-ng nodes: see
    [[Enterprise-wide message model (EWMM)]].

- How messages are represented in syslog-ng OSE: see
    [[Message representation in syslog-ng OSE]].
