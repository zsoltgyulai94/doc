## Tools you need for local testing your documentation changes

1. [[Install Ruby and RubyGems|ruby-and-gems-install]]

   NOTE: On macOS at the moment of writing the latest Ruby version is 3.3.1 and that can be compiled without any issues by homebrew (unlike the version 3.1.3 that is mentioned by the jekyllrb site)
   {: .notice--info}
2. Install bundler\
   It's just a ruby gem itself too, so simply run `gem install bundle`
3. [[Install node.js|mm-javascripts]] \
   It's needed only if you have to [[modify and re-pack|doc-own-tools#modify-and-repack-js]] the site wide .js script files
