## Tools you need for local testing your documentation changes

1. [[Install Ruby and RubyGems|ruby-and-gems-install]]
2. Install bundler\
   It's just a ruby gem itself too, so simply run `gem install bundle`
3. [[Install node.js|mm-javascripts]] \
   It's needed only if you have to [[modify and re-pack|doc-own-tools#modify-and-repack-js]] the site wide .js script files
