## GitHub
GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service. It provides Git repositories
with many different services that can be integrated into your development process.
Open source projects can be communicated on GitHub because it has a great issue and collaboration system.
We also use GitHub issues to discuss feature requests and track the process of development by synchronizing our ideas successively.

We also prefer contributing by forking our repository and sending pull-requests from your forked repository to ours on GitHub.

## Waffle.io
[Waffle.io](http://waffle.io) is a Kanban-styled issue management tool that helps you classify your backlogs state during the process of development. It supports integration to GitHub so issues on GitHub are totally alike to backlogs on Waffle.io. This new perspective given by this tool offers you the opportunity to see the pipeline of development. You can register using your GitHub account.

We would like to give you an overview about the columns in our Waffle.io.

[Balabitâ€™s Waffle.io table](http://waffle.io/balabit/syslog-ng)

#### Feature proposals
We would like to expand the capabilities of syslog-ng so we have decided to create this place for ideas. The following is a template for feature proposals. Using this guide you can create a proper description of your idea that is easy to understand. However, this is only a guideline, if you want to add more information, you are welcome to do so.

1. **Short description:**
Description of your feature in 3-5 sentences. Try to focus on functionality, high-level use-case.

2. **Use-case:**
Description of the reasons why you think it is a good idea to implement this feature into syslog-ng.

3. **Done definition:**
A list of criteria that must be met before you consider this feature "done" or implemented. It is advised that you associate this with the use-cases.

4. **Realization:**
Description of the implementation process that you think is viable for this feature. 

5. **Questions:**
List of questions that should be discussed before starting the implementation process.

#### Backlog
An item in this column represents a task connected to bugs, or smaller feature proposals to already existing features. Issues created the first time are placed here.

#### Blocked
A task in this columns is stuck for some reason (for example it requires other dependencies to be completed first) or the community does not want to deal with it for some reason. 

#### Ready
An item from the backlog is moved here if the implementation details are already known.

#### In progess
This column contains the issues that someone is currently working on. GitHub issues automatically receive an `in progress` tag when they are moved here.

#### Done
An issue is done when its done definition is fulfilled or the community considers it to be done.

## Travis CI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balabit/syslog-ng.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balabit/syslog-ng)

Travis CI is a continuous integration service that is free for open source projects. You can specify the process of deploying your product in a `.travis.yml` file that runs every time when you push your branch
to the repository.

Our Travis CI runs tests and checks on Linux and MacOSX platform using gcc and clang compilers to test the build.
It is advised to integrate Travis CI with your forked repository to test every commit you push. If you do not want to do this, CI will be run on your pull-request.

## Criterion

Criterion is a unit test framework used in the unit tests of syslog-ng. It can be compiled from 
source or installed as it is available as a .deb package.

Its documentation is extensive and full of examples. More test examples can be found in the source of 
syslog-ng under the `tests/unit` folder.

### Installation on Ubuntu

```
$ curl http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/laszlo_budai:/syslog-ng/xUbuntu_12.04/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/laszlo_budai:/syslog-ng/xUbuntu_12.04 ./" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syslog-ng-obs.list
$ sudo apt install criterion criterion-dev
```

[Documentation of Criterion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

## Astyle

Astyle is a source code formatter which makes sure that all of the C sources are formatted properly. 
Please make sure that version `2.05.1` is installed, as there might be differences between the formatting 
of different versions.

The version `2.05.1` can be also installed from the OBS repository used above.

### Usage

It is advised to format sources before submitting a PR. This makes easier to process PRs both for the reviewers and the contributors. To check if there is a adly formatted file run `make style-check`. To correct 
badly formatted ones run `make style-format`.

Following is the sampla output of calling these commands.

```
$ make style-check
Checking C source files
Formatting tests/unit/test_example.c
Number of badly formatted files: 1
$ make style-format
Formatting C source files
Formatting tests/unit/test_example.c
```

## Coverity

Coverity is an online service that helps you to analyze your code statically (Coverity Scan). It can reveal many defects
that are hidden in your code. It also categorizes your defects based on several different aspects like priority, security risk,
type, and also calculates defect density that can be compared to other open source projects. 
Coverity Scan can be integrated to Travis CI if needed, in order to run the analysis of code automatically.

You can also have Coverity Scan on your fork but we do not advise it because it takes a long time to configure and this analysis can be run only limited times a week for open-source projects. We will run analysis before every release to solve defects.
