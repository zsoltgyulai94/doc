One of the easiest ways to contribute to the development of syslog-ng
is to participate in the discussions about features, bugs and design.
Some of these discussions are started on the
[mailing list][ar:mailing-list], some in the
[issue tracker][ar:issue-tracker]. Bugs tagged
[`help`][ar:issues:help] are generally good targets to contribute your
feedback - but pretty much any open issue can be a good start.

We use [waffle.io][ar:waffle] as our story board, to prioritize issues
and guide the development. Use this interface for browsing existing
issues and pull requests.

If you find a bug or request a feature, create an issue for it.
There is no ultimate form for an issue but consider some of these basic ideas: 

#### Common bullet points
* Short, informative sentences
* References to documents, other issues
* Picture (A picture is worth a thousand words)

#### Bullet points of an issue about...

##### Bug
* Short description of the phenomenon: what does the user experience?
* Configuration and architecture example to reproduce it
* Longer description of the bug (references to the documentation, why you think it is a bug)
* Possible explanations, ideas about the root cause

##### Feature
* Short description of the request
* Use-cases (why do you think it is worth implementing)
* Ideas about how feature implementation, what should be taken to consideration
