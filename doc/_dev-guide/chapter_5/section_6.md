When you report a bug, it is important to share as much relevant
information as you can, including:
 * version number of syslog-ng used;
 * the platform (operating system and its version, architecture, and so on);
 * a backtrace from the core file if the issue is a crash (this can be
invaluable);
 * if possible, a configuration that triggers the problem;
 * a detailed description of the issue.

To make it easy to read reports, if you send a configuration snippet,
or a backtrace, use
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks)
around them.
