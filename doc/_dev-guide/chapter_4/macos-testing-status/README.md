### Acknowledgement

The [original testing][ref:origin] was made by Yash Mathne, and we would like to say a huge thank you for the great, detailed work.

### Testing Methodology

Only the building and the corresponding unit tests are guaranteed on x86 macOS. This is a documentation of the tests done on the various sub-components of syslog-ng on both the architectures.

Syslog-ng is composed of various modules, each with its own set of plugins. Plugins are primarily one of the following types:

* Source Drivers
* Destination Drivers
* Template Functions
* Rewrite Functions
* Parsers

Most of the template functions and rewrite functions are simple text manipulation functions without any external dependencies and are theoretically expected to work without a hunch. However, some of them do have external dependencies (e.g.: python template-function) and thus need to be tested.

### Testing results
