title: network() Source Driver
description: >-
  The network() source driver can receive syslog messages conforming to RFC3164
  from the network using the TCP and UDP networking protocols. It belongs in the
  afsocket module.

### **Status**

| UDP | x86\_64 | Works |
| :-: | :-----: | :---: |
| UDP |   ARM   | Works |
| TCP | x86\_64 | Works |
| TCP |   ARM   | Works |

**Note**\
The network source driver also includes TCP source listening on a TLS-encrypted channel, however, this is tested and verified in a separate post dealing with TLS-encryption with syslog-ng [here](tls-encryption/).

### **How to Test**

**Configuration File Used**

We can set up our syslog-ng configuration, such that it is listening for TCP and UDP protocol messages on the specified ports.

```config
@version: 3.31
@include "scl.conf"

options {
    stats-freq(10);
};

source s_network_tcp {
    network(port(1999) transport("tcp"));
};

source s_network_udp {
    network(port(5060) transport("udp"));
};

destination console{
    file(/dev/stdout);
};

log {
    source(s_network_udp);
    source(s_network_tcp);
    destination(console);
};
```

**Test Functionality and Proof**

When we run syslog-ng with this configuration file, we will begin a server that listens on the respective ports. We can also use netcat, a tool built into macOS, to connect to the recently opened port from the client-side and test it by sending messages.

**Note:** By default, using the network driver will cause syslog-ng to listen on IPv4, which is why we have used the -4 flag with netcat to force IPv4. This can be skipped with TCP as it will try to connect on IPv6, determine this isnâ€™t working, and retry with IPv4. But UDP being connectionless, cannot detect it should fall back to IPv4.
