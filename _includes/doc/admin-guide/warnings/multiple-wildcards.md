![]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/caution.png) **CAUTION:**
If you use multiple wildcard-file() sources in your configuration, make sure
that the files and folders that match the wildcards do not overlap. That is,
every file and folder should belong to only one file source. Monitoring a file
from multiple wildcard sources can lead to data loss.
