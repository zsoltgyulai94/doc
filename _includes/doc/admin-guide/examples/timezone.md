and [[A note on timezones and timestamps]].

The timezone can be specified by using the name, for example,
time-zone("Europe/Budapest"), or as the timezone offset in +/-HH:MM
format, for example, +01:00. On Linux and UNIX platforms, the valid
timezone names are listed under the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory.
