## tags()

|Type: |     string|
|Default:||

*Description:* Label the messages received from the source with custom
tags. Tags must be unique, and enclosed between double quotes. When
adding multiple tags, separate them with comma, for example,
**tags("dmz", "router")**. This option is available only in
syslog-ng 3.1 and later.
