*Description:* The name of a file that contains an unencrypted private
key in PEM format, suitable as a TLS key. If properly configured, the
syslog-ng OSE application uses this private key and the matching
certificate (set in the cert-file() option) to authenticate the
syslog-ng OSE client on the destination server.
