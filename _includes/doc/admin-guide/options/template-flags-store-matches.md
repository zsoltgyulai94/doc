### store-matches

Stores the matches of the regular expression into the \$0, \... \$255
variables. The \$0 stores the entire match, \$1 is the first group of
the match (parentheses), and so on. Named matches (also called named
subpatterns), for example, (?\<name\>\...), are stored as well. Matches
from the last filter expression can be referenced in regular
expressions.
