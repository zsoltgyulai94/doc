**NOTE:** At least one of the config() and the properties_file() options is
mandatory. While you can specify everything in the config() option if
you want, the properties-file() is optional. If you have an option in
both the config() and the properties-file() specified, the option
specified later in the syslog-ng OSE configuration file will prevail.
